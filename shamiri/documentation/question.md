# Rick & Morty API Challenge
## Project
### Build an app using the Rick & Morty API to do the following:
- Retrieve a list of locations (name and type), along with the residents of that location and their status.
- Implement the ability to search or filter location results by location name, character name or episode name.
- Display the data in a manner that allows you to view the location, its residents and see an image of the resident with a representation of their name & status.
- Tapping on a resident will navigate to a screen with the resident’s details. On this screen, you should be able to open a form that allows you to add persisted notes about the character.
-You can use a database or local storage or something else to implement persistence. Be sure to communicate your reasoning about whatever implementation method you choose.
### Guidelines
- Choose the GraphQL or REST endpoint and explain your choice.
-We mainly use TypeScript, Next.js, & tailwindcss for full-stack projects and so we strongly prefer you use this or a similar stack that allows you to showcase both your frontend and backend skills.
- Please document all design and implementation decisions you make in a README.md, including the rationale behind them.
